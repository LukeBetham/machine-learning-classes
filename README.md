# machine-learning-classes
A short project where I created 2 classes which combine many of the scikit-learn tools for both regression and classification tasks in order to simplify the process of creating and saving model results. In addition, I have integrated many visualisation and measurement functions within the class.

Regression Class - This class focuses on linear regression and is to be used for predicting continuous variables. The below algorithms are included:
- Linear
- ...

Classification Class - This class is for classification problems. The below models are included:
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
